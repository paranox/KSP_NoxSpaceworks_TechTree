# KSP_TechTree_SpaceColonization
Custom tech tree for my space-colonization-focused low-tech-start Kerbal Space Program career.

## Features
The tech tree spreads out as a web of sorts from the center of the canvas. It has distinct categories as clearly defined paths but nodes often still require other nodes from different tech categories to be researched as prerequisites.

You start out with very low-tech unmanned probes and you shouldn't expect to reach space immediately. It will be much easier to get basic manned airplanes than basic manned rockets that reach space.
