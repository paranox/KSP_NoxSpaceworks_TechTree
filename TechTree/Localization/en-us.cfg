		// Tech level 1
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_simpleElectrics_title = Simple Electrics
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_simpleElectrics_description = We did know about electricity before inventing space flight. The big breakthrough here was combining the two.

		// Tech level 2
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_basicComms_title = Basic Communications
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_basicComms_description = It turns out a set of metallic rods charged with electricity can transfer some of it's energy to another one nearby. We don't really know how this could be of use though.

		// Tech level 3
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedSubsonicFlight_title = Improved Subsonic Flight
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedSubsonicFlight_description = Throwing more components at an engine block makes it better, right?
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_shortRangeComms_title = Short Range Communications
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_shortRangeComms_description = We need larger metallic rods to transmit messages between greater distances.

		// Tech level 4
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advSurvivability_title = Advanced Survivability
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advSurvivability_description = The engineers thinks we need to prepare for catastrophic failures, not just successes. The public relations department was against the idea until they were told we could fit more pastries in our spacecrafts.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advSubsonicFlight_title = Advanced Subsonic Flight
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advSubsonicFlight_description = We never thought we could be going so fast while going so slow!
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedFlightControl_title = Improved Flight Control
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedFlightControl_description = Larger flying things need bigger control-giving things. Despite Jebediah's numerous requests, and the resounding success of the vehicle at amusement parks, we are not going to turn Vomit Komet into a real spacecraft.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_orbitalSurveys_title = Orbital Surveys
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_orbitalSurveys_description = Wernher von Kerman wanted us to take pictures of a neighbour for some research project of his. We couldn't get a good angle from the trees in his yard so we needed to get the camera a bit higher. Unfortunately the camera will now be too far away to get a good picture.

		// Tech level 5
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_experimentalSubsonicFlight_title = Experimental Subsonic Flight
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_experimentalSubsonicFlight_description = Some of these new jet engines are almost capable of breaching the sound barrier. It doesn't mean they're quiet. In fact it's quite the opposite.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedActuators_title = Improved Actuators
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedActuators_description = We're still not totally convinced one doesn't need explosions to properly move things around. However, it seems we can attach things on the go with these.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedLanding_title = Improved Landing
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedLanding_description = Our engineers are adamant on actually getting this right. We're not holding our breath for it but we'll play along this time.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_motors_title = Electric Motors
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_motors_description = Electric motors are like alternators in rocket engines, except in reverse. Naturally they consume energy instead of generating it, but we realized attaching wheels to them also makes it move at the same time.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_resourceManagement_title = Resource Management
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_resourceManagement_description = Bringing more snacks along will enable longer missions they said. We say a breathable atmosphere could be nice too.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_sensorTech_title = Sensor Technology
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_sensorTech_description = We have managed to improve our metallic rods into sensors that can detect minute changes in many things. We also learned that hammering trash can lids into a bowl shape improves the signal received by them. Too bad it also makes it impossible to receive anything from other directions. This means we can now talk to ever more distant things. Possibly all the way to Mun.
		
		// Tech level 6
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advElectronics_title = Advanced Electronics
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advElectronics_description = This new batch of microchips... no, not the edible kind! Anway, we found out we couldn't run the Goosweeper on our old workstations so we made bigger CPUs out of smaller parts. It can also heat up your snacks!
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_emSystems_title = Electromagnetic Systems
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_emSystems_description = We found out how and why our communication devices worked to begin with. We can definitely put this to a better use than just talking at distance.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedHeatManagement_title = Improved Heat Management
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedHeatManagement_description = We have finally saved our snacks from premature overheating by diverting the excess heat away from them.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_longRangeComms_title = Long Range Communications
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_longRangeComms_description = We have found out that there are better ways to create bowl shapes than just hammering sheets of metal. We should be able to reach just beyond Mun with these.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedMotors_title = Improved Motors
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedMotors_description = We realized that bigger vehicles can't really use these small wheels we used to have.

		// Tech level 7
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advFlightSystems_title = Advanced Flight Systems
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advFlightSystems_description = These engines can make your jet plane take off vertically. Hopefully they'll also allow you to land the same way without disassembling the vessel too much!
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advResourceManagement_title = Advanced Resource Management
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advResourceManagement_description = We realized we could actually refine materials found on other planets or asteroids into more useful resources. Now we only need to figure out how to get there in one piece.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_heavyControl_title = Heavy Control
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_heavyControl_description = Unreasonably large rockets need suitably unreasonable control systems to keep their attitude in check.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_highPressureContainment_title = High-Pressure Containment
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_highPressureContainment_description = Some fuel tanks require high pressure to be practical in terms of size and performance. Just don't poke these.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_interplanetaryComms_title = Interplanetary Communications
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_interplanetaryComms_description = These communication dishes should actually be able to reach nearby planets although we haven't received any response from Duna as of yet.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_offworldMining_title = Off-World Mining
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_offworldMining_description = We're going to need an expert crew to handle drilling missions in space. Thankfully Wernher von Kerman knows just the right people to recruit some discharged oil-drilling-specialists.

		// Tech level 8
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advComms_title = Advanced Communications
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advComms_description = These dishes can can reach almost anything orbiting Kerbol but they are really picky about being pointed exactly at the target. We can hardly think of a reason to invest in improving our communications devices. It's unlikely anyone will ever get to go outside their range, at least not while still alive.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_experimentalElectronics_title = Experimental Electronics
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_experimentalElectronics_description = These things are so powerful that they require active cooling. That won't exactly help with power consumption but they'll sure calculate things faster than Kerbals equipped with counting frames.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedFieldScience_title = Improved Field Science
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedFieldScience_description = We needed to improve the range of our field science operations. We thought the added heat generation from RTGs could help.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedLogistics_title = Improved Logistics
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedLogistics_description = The need to transport snacks and other resources more efficiently to wherever they're needed has resulted in an increase in the size of containers.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_largeControl_title = Large Control
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_largeControl_description = We're not sure where you could fit these in but we were told we need a bigger control apparatus for something. Just don't ask us to make these things any bigger.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_massiveVolumeContainment_title = Massive Volume Containment
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_massiveVolumeContainment_description = Those ridiculously large rocket engines we've developed will require matchingly ludicrous fuel sources.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_quiteExoticFuelStorage_title = Quite Exotic Fuel Storage
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_quiteExoticFuelStorage_description = These fancy fuels and their containers aren't that cheap but they will enable efficient space travel.

		// Tech level 9
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advFieldScience_title = Advanced Field Science
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advFieldScience_description = Field science has proven to be a fruitful branch of development. We still don't recommend trying to eat those pieces of rock you will be collecting.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advHabitation_title = Advanced Habitation
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_advHabitation_description = When keeping heavy station parts safely in orbit just isn't enough. We hope you have a good plan to land all of these necessary parts without too many explosions.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedEMSystems_title = Improved Electromagnetic Systems
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_improvedEMSystems_description = Experiments with electromagnetic containment systems have lead to an understanding that we really don't understand how electromagnetic forces really work. Still, these seem to do it better than our previous systems.

		// Tech level 10
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_automatedLogistics_title = Automated Logistics
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_automatedLogistics_description = These boxes practically move themselves!
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_expSurvivability_title = Experimental Survivability
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_expSurvivability_description = They don't call it experimental for nothing. Still, the prospects are astonishingly cool.
		
		// SpaceY Heavy Lifters tech node description changes
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_massiveStructure_description = Significantly larger structures are sometimes needed. For those times, we have these.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_giganticStructure_description = We don't think we can build any larger parts than these.

		// Stock tech node description changes
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_precisionEngineering_description = Precise engineering techniques allow for construction of small but very useful parts.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_electrics_description = We discovered alternative sources of electricity instead of an array of potatoes connected by wires. With this technology we can illuminate the R&D rooms without relying on open fires, letting our interns work during the night with less chance of, um... heated discussions.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_miniaturization_description = The science of things stuffed into other things they normally would not fit in. No, it's not only about crushing things in a screw bench and calling that an upgrade.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_nuclearPower_description = We realized these fancy glowing rocks can be used to run thermoelectric generators! They are relatively light and present less hazards than running steam turbines by burning fuel. They still get hot so remember to add thermal control parts to your vessels!
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_specializedCommandModules_description = We have gotten a lot of complaints from Jeb that our command modules don't have big enough windows to properly see around the spacecraft. He asked for slightly larger windows but the engineers misread the note. Now we have command modules made almost entirely of windows.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_specializedFlightSystems_description = They told us we could make a slow aircraft that can take off and land vertically. We almost fired them but then they told us the propeller could also double as a large lawn mower in an emergency.
		#LOC_NOX_TECH_aerospaceTech_description = Aircraft that go to space and return? That sounds like a good way to save cash for snacks! Er, I mean development of new technologies!
